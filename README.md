# PhenoVelocity
This repository has R code and data associated with a manuscript "Phenological response to climatic change depends on seasonal warming velocity and species traits" by Rob Guralnick, Theresa Crimmins, Erin Grady, and Linday Campbell.  A separate Zenodo repository contains historical raw data (https://zenodo.org/records/11248026).
